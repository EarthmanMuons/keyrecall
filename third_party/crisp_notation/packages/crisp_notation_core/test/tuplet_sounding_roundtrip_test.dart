/// only direction that matters: dropping or mis-deriving a ratio leaves the
/// notated value untouched and changes the music. Four real defects hid behind
/// it, and each has a test below.
///
/// The dual trap is a false alarm. Neither `**kern` nor ABC records a tuplet
/// BRACKET, so a reader has to re-derive one, and it may legitimately come back
/// respelled — a septuplet of eighths in the time of 8 is the same sound as the
/// conventional 7:4 of quarters. Comparing sounding duration accepts that and
/// still catches a wrong ratio.
